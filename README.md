### Machine Learning Utils

This repository contain various machine learning utils that will be very usefull through out the journey. These utils include some helper functions, and some cool features that will help us to create Nueral Network Faster.

### What are Nueral Networks?

Neural networks are one of the earliest examples of a machine learning model. Neural networks were initially introduced in the 1940s and have risen and fallen several times from popularity. The current generation of deep learning begain in 2006 with an improved training algorithm by Geoffrey Hinton. This technique finally allowed neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to be efficiently trained. Four researchers have contributed significantly to the development of neural networks. They have consistently pushed neural network research, both through the ups and downs.
